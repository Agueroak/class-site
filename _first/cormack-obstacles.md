* The main thing I had a problem with was whether to insert spaces after or before each of the footnotes/images I added. I had to go through a few trial and error sessions where I would add something and check that it showed up correctly in a Word Document or PDF and I think I finally got it.

**hm. I'm curious to know how you went from markdown to Word or PDF. What method did you use?**

* I had trouble saving the .md file to a specific folder that allowed me to find it using Terminal. I finally just had to save it to the desktop but it would be nice if I could have it in a folder for this specific assignment.

**The folder should be the folder inside the project called first (I renamed it from first-exercise just to type less). Do you know where it is now?**

* Uploading the files to the GitHub repository was probably the most confusing part - I had no idea whether to add my files to the master branch or whether to submit a pull request. I talked to Avery and think I figured it out.

**Yes you did!**

* Once I uploaded the .md file to the first-exercise folder and previewed it, I realized that none of my images or footnotes worked. I tested everything using Terminal to generate Word docs and PDFs and it looked fine and was formatted correctly, so I'm not sure what happened... but after redoing a few things I think the issue was that my images were linked to files on my computer instead of URLs. After Googling a solution, I also found a weird workaround for the footnotes so they show up as linked and formatted in Github.

**I fixed those for you. The issue is Github won't show footnotes. We ignore that**
