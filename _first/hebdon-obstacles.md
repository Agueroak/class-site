All of my troubles really came through working in the terminal. The tutorials were helpful, but it took me a few hours of practice before I felt that I could navigate confidently. 

I couldn't figure out how to convert the markdown document to a word document. Went down a few youtube rabbitholes and I think I got it to work finally.

**You did the conversions so you could see the results? You can see the results from now on in the website itself.**

Uploading the .md to github was challenging. I wasn't sure if my documents were supposed to be added to the master or not. Ended up collaborating with Jodi and Avery who helped me. 

**Glad to hear you guys are helping each other out.**
