## Problems

1. At the beginning I had some troubles with the links but I figured it out.

2. I couldn’t put the images. I don’t know what I did wrong, you are able to see the little blue square with a question mark but you can´t see the image. 

3. I´m also not sure that I did the footnotes correctly. 

4. I don’t know how to add my folders to the binder.


## Conclusion

It wasn’t as hard as I thought it was going to be. You just had to follow the instructions but when it came to insert footnotes and add images following instructions didn’t work, because I’m almost positive that I didn’t do that right. Hopefully the rest of the exercises were partially correct.
