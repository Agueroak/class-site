- Didn't really know what Markdown was
- Didn't know how/where to access Markdown
- Tutorials about Markdown didn't address my particular issues
- Couldn't figure out how to link
- Couldn't figure out how include images
- Putting in multiple footnotes took some time to understand how to do
- Wasn't immediately sure how to do the final export to .md 
- Didn't have access to the class Github repository

** That is a very well documented obstacle list. The best in the class. You did not hide any of your obstacles. That is going to be a very valuable skill going forward. I'm going to need your help helping your colleagues understand the importance of being as objective and thorough as possible when naming obstacles and failures. Not easy**

** On a related note. You figured out how to do everything! Great job. I fixed your footnotes to be markdown. That's it.**
