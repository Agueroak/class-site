## Embedding Image in Section 3
I inserted the wrong code, clearly because my first iteration shows up on my md file as ! [alt text] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/1/1d/Christmas_1992.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080619200904)
I FOLLOWED: ![GitHub Logo] (/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text] (url)
IT DIDN"T WORK

## Embedding a YouTube Video 
The first code I was working off of did not turn out: 
~~~
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YerQ1lYejNc" " target="_blank"><img src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YerQ1lYejNc.jpg" alt="Learn Something" width="240" height="180" border='10' /></a>
~~~

so I did further research and used a much simpler code vis-Ã -vis GitHub's website cheatsheet on MarkDown
That also didn't work...I realized I had to at '/0.jpg' after the video URL for the thumbnail image to appear

**notice I used markdown for code so your code shows now** 

## Embedding Links
Wow I did this so wrong and I'm sort of confused why the code I was using turned out so terribly wrong. Oh--I think its because I put a space in between the `[title](http://)`

**yes, yes it was**

## Footnotes
After 3 tries for embedding/adding footnotes I have come to a cross roads, I can't figure it out

**you had it right the first time. you were just looking at the page rudimentary layout on github itself, rather than on the published site. i fixed it back to original**

## Frustrations
Altogether I feel really stupid for not being able to figure out how to embedd an image and then an image thumbnail for the youtube video but I need a break from trying to figure this out after 3.5 hours...maybe I'll figure it out in a couple of days

**you have done an amazing job of figuring out stuff. you should've seen me trying to figure out how to unbreak the site from a bug I made!! Took me about 5 hours. I still don't feel stupid, but gave myself a big doh at the end. that's allowed.**
