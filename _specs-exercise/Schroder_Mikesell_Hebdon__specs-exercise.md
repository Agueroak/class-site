**Introduction to the project:** <br>
Congregating color (Avery), shape (Jodi), and material (Bronte) together in one place in an effort to substantiate and further explain the JDM plates to an interested public. Avery will be working on collecting terms related to color as extant in JDM text that is meant to accompany the colored plates, from here she will create a working dictionary/glossary of what exactly each term means and how we might, as 21st century readers, understand the term in its original 18th century context(s); Jodi will be working on discussing shape and silhouette as defined by foundation garments and looking generally at manifestations of female sexuality and independence through clothing as seen in colored JDM plates; Bronte will be working, in a similar fashion to Avery's project, though with terms relating to textiles so as to create a textile dictionary/glossary that will help visitors to the site better understand material types in regards to clothing (Bronte), construction (Jodi) and particular value of colors to material. (Avery)

**1 user story:** <br>
Ideally, we would like the viewer to 'fall down the rabbit hole' as it were and find things within our website that he/she might not have happened upon unless it was for an interest in a particular color, shape, or material. They will access the JDM plates through one of thse three potential entry points, all of which will be linked both visually and through a shared color & materials glossary. Through this networked interface our hope is that the viewer will move freely between these different categories and gaining perspective on how they might intersect. 

**Technological stack:** <br>
Avery will create a useable color bar (as exemplified in her slide presentation for class today) that will be able to be toggled over by visitors as a quasi search bar; when one clicks on a color, users will be taken to a separate page dedicated to said color; here the color will be given it's dictionary/glossary definition (as created by Avery using eighteenth century dictionaries and other primary sources), hopefully a brief commentary will be given below contextualizing this color's use in its eighteenth century context as it related to social constructs, clothing styles perhaps, and anything Avery can find on how it was made; below this will be all of the plates that students in this course are working on individually that include said color in them...these plates located below the dictionary/glossary entry and the commentary entry will be navigable and linkable (HOPEFULLY) to their respective translated pages and any extraneous pages that other individuals are working on regarding them

Jodi will create a timeline potentially using Javascript event handlers tied to area elements or Flash. Creating a web apllication may be beyond the scope or time we have available to us, so this is a best case scenario. I don't have the architecture fully mapped out in my head just yet, but before I go off the deep end I'd like to know what kind of limitations we're working with. Otherwise, we'll be using HTML & CSS.

**Division of labor:** <br>
Avery: pull color terms, research terms, create dictionary/glossary excel sheet (that will be used as metadata possibly??), field emails from class mates with color terms they come across in their personal transcribing of their individual plates, create color bar by photoshopping pure color reserves in these plates, build out color bar and respective pages for the colors, research use of colors /relate to Jodi and Bronte's projects in any vein possible

Jodi: Research, research, research for personal topic, topic network architecture, supply related terms to joint glossary, explore web application possibilities, write content, & assist with technology issues for linked projects.

**Time distribution:** <br>
Avery: have working color bar and linkable pages ready to go before thanksgiving, continually work on gathering color terms until all plates are due and then begin working on color glossary and color commentary due with final content

Jodi: Finalize mapping architecture and needed technology before end of Oct. Create basic working structure before Thanksgiving. Create glossary collaboratively before end of Nov. Refine, refine, refine till end of project.
