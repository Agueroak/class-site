# Emily and Bronte JDM Projects

## Our Projects
Emily: My project idea aims to explore the Journal des Dames et des Modes as a material object that was read and owned by men and women in France during this time. In investigating its production, distribution, and readership, I hope to give audiences looking at our online project a sense of the physical journal that could be held and carried. One of the questions I hope to address is on the subject of the journal’s original binding. According to Kleinert, the JDM was originally eight pages of text plus one or two plates. To give an idea of what this thin booklet may have looked like, and because surviving editions of the journal in libraries today have separated the text and plates, I would like to create a sort of separate digital book using images of text and JPEGs from the Morgan. Ideally, this feature would allow viewers to see what the weekly editions may have looked like (zooming in, turning pages, showing full spread, etc.), and in conjunction with the plates of figures holding the JDM, will give an idea of what the object looked like originally. 

Bronte: My project aims to connect the men's fashion plates of le Journal des Dames et des Modes to the materiality of men's textiles. The men's fashion plates changed dramatically between 1797 and 1804. This is visible in the styling of the clothing which varies from tight and revealing to bulbous and thickly layered. My project will analyze the changing materiality of these fashions with the hope of connecting masculine materialities to feminine. This hopes to answer whether textile use was gendered in its application to the extent that historians believe. If textiles were in fact gendered, the question must be asked as to how these fashions were adopted on the streets of Paris. Because men's fashion was still somewhat hierarchical (military, government uniforms, etc) the way these fashion plates were interpreted could appear different depending on many factors. Was this application a factor of readership? how much access would men have had to the JDM? 

## User Stories
Emily:
As a user, I want to create a compilation of images from digitized JDM to create a "book" which is clickable for turning pages and includes a zoom feature to see small details on the page surface.

Bronte:
I would like to create two interactive elements. First, a dictionary of textile and clothing terms that would have user functionality connected to the plates where each word is located. I would also like to design a system where the user could hover their mouse over the plate and visualize a sample of the textile. 

## Desiderada
Emily:
* High-quality TIFFs or JPEGs of the text portions of JDM, preferably those that correspond to the particular plates we are discussing
* Learn if and how it might be possibe to create a digital "booklet" to show what the JDM would have looked like with 8 pages and 1-2 plates
* Continue research about female literacy rates during this period and how journals like this would have been purchased, delivered, and kept/disposed of
* Continue research about late 18th-century bindings, possibly looking at other revolutionary pamphlets online or in nearby library/museum collections
* Find usable images of the text that correspond with one of the plates in which a female figure is reading the JDM
* Figure out how to arrange the images of the pages so it gives a digital sense of the physical book (pages turning, high-resolution images of creases/stitches, binding, watermarks?)
* Include both images from plates where figures are reading as well as current photographs of someone holding the books at the Morgan for scale 


Bronte:
* compile dictionary terms
* meet with librarians at the Ratti Textile center, possibly FIT to search for contemporary sample books or gain access to examples of period textiles for the men. 
* continue research into men's government and military uniforms in order to make or break connections with civilian dress.


## Labor Required
Emily: For my first idea, the main issue is figuring out what sort of digital imaging is necessary for showing JPEGs as "book pages." 

Bronte: If I can locate primary source textiles, I will need to photograph those textiles and upload them to the website. Connecting them to each plate will require technical help. If I cannot locate primary textiles, I will need to find contemporary samples and photograph them.
