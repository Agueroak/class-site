 # Final Project


## Defining the project 

By mapping the fashion hotspots mentioned on the Journal des Dames et des Modes plates, this project will visualize the spaces of fashionable sociability in Paris during this radical style revolution. Despite the Journal’s attempts to legitimize the fashions presented by citing specific dates and locations, we will question whether these looks presented in the Journal were meant to record reality or to posit fanciful sartorial suggestions to women. This map will explore the relationships between revolutionary fashion and real life in a way that will shed new light on the radical fashions of this period as well as the Parisian urban experience during the Revolutionary period. 


## My part of the project Ana Karen (@agueroak)

For my share in the project, I will photoshop the figures in the plates 58 until 73 to the actual location where they were supposedly spotted. The places in the background will be taken from the period that the plate was made to create more accuracy. I will also try to photoshop other people in the background to contextualize what was the general public´s reaction and dress code like. Finally, this images will be part of the map and will pop-up depending on where in the map you click-on.

## Tasks to accomplish

* Learn how to use Photoshopin order to create a visual representation to reconstruct the way in which outfits were spotted.(Reality vs. Fiction)

* Incorporate the Plates to the mapping project with Sarah and work on the challenges that this creation of the map may include. 

* Add some text to support the images and mapping project. Maybe thought bubbles that also pop-up in the images.
