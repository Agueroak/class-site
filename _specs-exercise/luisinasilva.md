<**Contribution to the Style Revolution Class**>

<*French Fashion in Mexico*>

<The purpose of my dissertation is to identify and to conceptualize the relationships and the transmission of ideas of the fashion system of the Colonial Spanish empire. My study focuses on Peru and Mexico and encompasses the period from the mid-eighteenth century with the opening of many cities and ports on both sides of the Atlantic, to the consolidation of the independence revolutions in Latin America.>

<During my archival research for my dissertation I spent 2 months in Lima and 3 months in Mexico City collecting data form different historical archives, museums and libraries. From the several documents that found I have noticed that the Spanish Inquisition had a huge impact on the Mexican territory. Unlike other viceroyalties, New Spain -that includes what is today Mexico, Central America, the south of the United States, the Philippines, Guam, Mariana and Caroline Islands- suffered the Spanish Inquisition much more than the ones of Peru, Rio de la Plata and New Granada. I have five documents that are part of the Inquisition archive from 1773 to the early 1800s’ that mention French fashion and “estampas francesas” (French prints). I also have five newspaper articles from *Diario de Mexico* and *Gaceta del Gobierno de Mexico* with dates ranging from 1807 to 1811 that discuss the French fashion trends of the time.>

<For my project I need to: 
-	Digitize the material
-	OCR 
-	Translate from Spanish to English (at least the relevant parts)
-	Text analysis  
-	Explain the findings and make connections with the French plates>

<I would like to work with these documents as a contribution for the class and to open the question of how far did the French fashion stamps reached. In some of the articles we read in class they mention the fashion plates circulated around Europe, but did they made it to the Americas?>
