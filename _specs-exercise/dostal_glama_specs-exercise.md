## Zoe Dostal 
For my project I want to compare and contrast British fashion plates with JDM fashion plates to determine the mutual influences and dissimilarities in fashion developments of both men and women's clothing from 1797-1804. I will also consider the history of cross-channel fashion exchange prior to the French Revolution and the effects of the Treaty of Amiens. 

> ### Desiderata
* Complete a survey of all available JDM text to find references to England and British fashion
* Visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Yale Center for British art to study two of the most popular British fashion magazines *Gallery of Fashion* and *Magazine of Female Fashions of London and Paris*
* Use digital databases and local libraries/archives to find plates from a variety of other British fashion magazines
* Potentially identify key caricatures, oil paintings, and/or other artworks to complement my primary material of fashion plates
* Come up with a (manageably sized! 5-8?) list of points of comparison (ie. specific hats, specific dress styles etc.)
* Using photoshop create a simple, visually appealing grid of these points of comparison so that when each item is selected it will lead to a second grid specific to that item with clickable images (fashion plates, portraits, caricatures etc.) that will each reveal more about the significance of that clothing item in London vs. Paris.
