#### User stories

- [medium] As a [user], I want to [find a way to create a digital tool that can help me compare and contrast the political discourse on revolutionnary clothing and fashion magazine rhetoric].
- [high] As a [user], I want to [create a dynamic timeline where I could compare and contrast plates from the *Journal des Dames et des Modes* and several other prints].

#### Desiderata

- I need to define a precise body of primary sources, that could include, besides several plates from the JDM, some laws, decrees and pamphlets (which I could find in the recently digitalized pamphlet collection of the Newberry Library) and other prints, paintings and drawings pertaining to the official masculine revolutionnary costume.
- I probably need to think about a glossary of technical terms used to define such costumes, to compare and contrast the language of clothing in political discourses and fashion magazines.
- I would like to look at the evolution of official masculine costumes, from David's project to Napoleon's uniform as Premier Consul, to see how and at what stage the influence of fashion is involved.
