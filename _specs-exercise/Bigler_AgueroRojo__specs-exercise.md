# **Defining our project**
## *Mapping Places of Fashionable Sociability in Revolutionary France*

By mapping the fashion hotspots mentioned on the Journal des Dames et des Modes plates, this project will visualize the spaces of fashionable sociability in Paris during this radical style revolution. Despite the Journal’s attempts to legitimize the fashions presented by citing specific dates and locations, we will question whether these looks presented in the Journal were meant to record reality or to posit fanciful sartorial suggestions to women. Sometimes it is really hard to distinguish what is real and what is an imaginary or fantasy suggestion, especially in the fashion world. Even today we can look at some magazine editorials or catwalks and see an outfit that is “crazy” and “no one will ever wear that in real life” but when we look at outfits in a magazine from more than 300 years ago, when there was no photography, identifying if a street style of that outfit becomes problematic. In addition, understanding the  that is why, for our final project we wanted to create a visual representation for the spectator of how the outfits shown in the Journal des dames et des modes plates were worn in Paris´ streetstyle. By doing this, we intent to This map will explore the relationships between revolutionary fashion and real life in a way that will shed new light on the radical fashions of this period as well as the Parisian urban experience during the Revolutionary period. contextualize fashion in real life and discover some major secrets that can help us understand what was it like to live in Paris after the French Revolution. 

# **My part of the project (Ana Karen)**
For my share in the project, I will photoshop the figures in the plates 58 until 73 to the actual location where they were supposedly spotted. The places in the background will be taken from the period that the plate was made to create more accuracy.  I will also try to photoshop other people in the background to contextualize what was the general public´s reaction and dress code like. Finally, this images will be part of the map and will pop-up depending on where in the map you click-on. 

# **My part of the project (Sarah)**
I will be creating an interactive map of the fashion hot-spots cited on the plates of the Journal des Dames et des Modes. The map will use as its base the 1790 plan de P. Verniquet. I will mark the eighteen locations mentioned on the plates of the Journal. When users click on these marked locations a contemporary  image of the location will pop up. I have been researching the locations and compiling the contemporary images. I also hope to write an overview for the mark as well as perhaps a few sentences to accompany each location giving a brief summary of the location during this time period and its relationship to revolutionary fashion. 

# **Tasks to accomplish**
* Identify the locations listed on the plates 
* Research the locations of these specific sites
* Find a digitized map of Paris from the time period to use as the basis of the interactive map
* Track down contemporary images of these locations
* Ana Karen will photoshop figures from the plates onto these contemporary images to reconstruct reality, or the supposed reality that the Journal presents.
* Figure out how to create the interactive map where these photoshopped images pop up when you click/hover over them
* Write the accompanying text

# **What we expect to do/problems we expect to encounter**  
Since my research is already finished, I am more than halfway done with my part of the project. Now comes the difficult part of actually executing the map. I need to figure out what software is necessary as well as deal with issues surrounding acquiring the rights to use the map as well as the supplemental images that Ana Karen will edit. We will both need to learn how to create this type of photoshopped image as well. I also foresee us having some difficulties in exporting the map and putting it up onto the finished website. I think all the technical aspects of this project will require lots of assistance from Alex since I have no experience with this type of digital map-making.
