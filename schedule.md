-   **Resistance in the materials:** In this, your first technological trial by fire, you will produce two files and upload them to a specific folder in the class GitHub repository: File \#1 (.md): Using Markdown and a plain text editor, design a 3000-word, Lorem Ipsum document with title, author, sections and subsections, footnotes, at least one image and links; *We expect you to hit several technological hurdles doing this exercise*, and we want you to try to be as resourceful as you can to try to overcome them on your own—the only time we will ask you to do so—which brings us to File \#2 (.md): Using Markdown and a plain text editor, document any and all obstacles or problems you encountered doing this exercise as a bullet point list. If you were not able to commit the first file to GitHub, you have the option to submit both files by email.
