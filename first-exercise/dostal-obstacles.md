## Obstacles
### Zoe Dostal

* Like everyone else so far, my biggest problem is footnotes. Although the footnote showed up in the text [^1] it didn't actually show up
as a footnote below, which is very frustrating. I tried to find a solution for awhile, but given how many other people were having issues
(and I agree, I don't love the way it looks either with the ^ sign) I figured we will go over this as a group.
* The image took some time to perfect, but it was just a matter of making sure I was linking to the photograph and not a website...
steep learning curve over here! But I got there in the end and was pretty pleased (The image is even a link! Fancy!)

[^1]: And now it's behaving differently in this document. I definitely need a footnote tutorial.
