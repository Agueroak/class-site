* I had forgotten to email my Github username to Prof. Gil and so I was unable to clone the class site. 

* HTML: I have some experience with HTML and I know that you can use HTML in Markdown, but you can't use Markdown in HTML. I was unsure if using both would cause issues on github, so even though I **really** wanted to use HTML throughout I mostly abstained.

* Footnotes: Figuring out how to use footnotes took me the longest amount of time. I didn't like how the footnotes appeared using [^1] so I used examples of both Markdown and HTML to format it the way I found visually appealing. I wasn't able to find an equivelent only in Markdown.

* I wasn't sure if Alex wanted to create a specific folder & folder name for the session 3 assignments, but I'm already here and ready to submit a pull request, so I'm sure he'll let me know if I'm heading in the wrong direction.
