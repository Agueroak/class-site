# **Overview/Response**
This exercise went ok, most things proved to be more straightforward than I had anticipated and I found that if I worked slowly I was able to figure most things out. I also worked with my friend who works in tech to help me work through my initial panic and she was very encouraging that the whole process was mangeable and that I would be ok. 

# **Struggles**
 
## **Footnotes**
I am still not sure I did the footnotes correctly. The instructions I found made it seem to easy. it appears to have worked sort of on my final document but I am not sure I really did it correctly. 

## **Embedding Images & Video**
Inserting the image was the biggest challenge I had. Initially, I wanted to insert a GIF or a video for fun to see how it worked, but this turned out to be way to difficult. So, I gave up and stuck to inserting a regular image, which I still had to google how to do correctly, but I eventually figured it out (i think)

# **Did I actually do this right?**
Overall, I think it went ok but I am still not 100% sure I did everything entirely correctly or if things worked in the ways they were supposed to. So hopefully overtime I will improve and become more confident in the whole process.
